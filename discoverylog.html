				<h1>Week 01</h1>

				<p>In week 1 of university we were given the logins to our VMs (Virtual Machines) which are locally hosted and require the VPN in order to connect too. This was many people's first experiance at using linux (The VMs run on Debian). We were instructed to connect to the VM by using the SSH (Secure Shell) Protocol.</p>

				<p>In order to use SSH an SSH client is required. One of the moar popular choices of clients was putty. We were recommended to use a browser plugin to connect if we were unfamiliar, however I already had GitBash installed so I decided that I'd prefer to use that.</p>
