				<h1>Week 01</h1>

				<p>In week 1 of university we were given the logins to our VMs (Virtual Machines) which are locally hosted and require the VPN in order to connect too. This was many people's first experiance at using linux (The VMs run on Debian). We were instructed to connect to the VM by using the SSH (Secure Shell) Protocol.</p>

				<p>In order to use SSH an SSH client is required. One of the moar popular choices of clients was putty. We were recommended to use a browser plugin to connect if we were unfamiliar, however I already had GitBash installed so I decided that I'd prefer to use that.</p>

				<h2>Week 02</h2>

				<p>At the beginning of this week we started by trying to write down all of the various types of data that we, as individuals, generate on a daily basis. Then we considered how this information would be captured online and how it can be used by companies.</p>

				<p>Having settled on what information is generated daily by us, the data was to be sorted into categories. Where the categories are given as secret, sensitive and public. So, essentially a gradient of the information's confidentiality. With one requirement of all categories being in layman's terms and easy to understand to anyone.</p>
