				<h1>Week 01</h1>

				<p>In week 1 of university we were given the logins to our VMs (Virtual Machines) which are locally hosted and require the VPN in order to connect too. This was many people's first experiance at using linux (The VMs run on Debian). We were instructed to connect to the VM by using the SSH (Secure Shell) Protocol.</p>

				<p>In order to use SSH an SSH client is required. One of the moar popular choices of clients was putty. We were recommended to use a browser plugin to connect if we were unfamiliar, however I already had GitBash installed so I decided that I'd prefer to use that.</p>

				<h2>Week 02</h2>

				<p>At the beginning of this week we started by trying to write down all of the various types of data that we, as individuals, generate on a daily basis. Then we considered how this information would be captured online and how it can be used by companies.</p>

				<p>Having settled on what information we generate on a daily basis we were to sort the data into various categories. Where the categories essentially form a gradient of the information's respective confidentiality. The only requirement of the information is that all of the categories are to be described in Layman's terms and is therefore easy to understand by anyone.</p>

				<h2>Week 03</h2>

				<p>Within this week we started to look at various ways of researching content for our literature reviews.</p>

				<p>The literature review that's been set has the topic: "Mitigating personal information exposure on the web" so the session for this week was focused on helping us find a starting point for the review.
