				<h1 class="header">Mitigation of personal information exposure on the web</h1>
				<p>The primary aim of this literature review is to explore the possibilities of users having their personal information exposed on the internet through social networking sites or other online platforms. As of 2018 Facebook has an estimated 1.47 Billion users (Statista, 2018). Typically, any arbitrary social networking platform will give its users the ability to create and populate their own personalized online identity that may or may not be populated with authentic information. (Squicciarini & Giffin, 2012). Having such an identity present on the internet allows potentially malicious users to make efforts in launching social engineering attacks with the data that they are able to collected from publicly available, sensitive, data.</p>

				<p>There is a number of social engineering attacks that can be orchestrated to extract a user’s online data. Some of the more commonly known social engineering attacks involving fraudulent emails and inauthentic copies of legitimate websites. These emails/websites are designed in such a way that they may potentially manipulate a user into releasing sensitive data exposing them to the possibility of thievery or identity theft (William Collins Sons & Co. 2012).</p>

				<p>The primary goal of a phishing email is generally to manipulate the recipient that it is from a genuine source such as their bank. If the victim of the attack is convinced of this then they are likely to enter private/sensitive information at the request of any URLs that are embedded within the malicious email. The reasoning behind phishing being such a popular/strong tool for obtaining unauthorised access to user’s accounts is because with technical security measures increasing perpetually, people (Meaning staff working or account holders for any arbitrary online service) will remain vulnerable to manipulation and therefore the weakest link in any online network/account (Mouton, Leenen, & Venter, 2016).</p>

				<p>Another form that phishing exists in is with fake websites. Phishing websites follow the same principles as phishing emails. A phishing website is a website that impersonates an official service that user(s) hold account(s) with. Malicious users have created websites that imitate official government websites in order to convince users to submit various form(s) that will inevitably contain sensitive/personalized data; other websites of this nature will also charge a fee for such any pre-mentioned service (IC3 (Internet Crime Complaint Centre), 2015). Once one of these users has obtained the funds/information that they intended to obtain they possess the ability to close all relevant sites within their operation that could potentially be used as evidence within a court of law.</p>

				<p>Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering attack which is much easier to conduct. Shoulder surfing is the process of obtaining someone’s confidential data by watching the user operate their device (Keele University, 2014). Shoulder surfing attacks primarily take place in crowded/busy settings, such as a train station or line in a store.</p>

				<p>Individuals that make use of social networking sites are not also competent with configuring their account’s privacy settings in such a way that it protects them from social engineering attacks. Should a user populate their online identity/identities with too much personalized information then it becomes possible for any user with malicious intent to potentially breach their account or other accounts owned by the same victim. This is done through answering security questions that are provided by the service in order to gain access (Federal Trade Commission, 2012). Encryption of a user’s data is another potentially vulnerability that is open to exploitation if the appropriate security steps are not taken. In order to ensure that a connection to a web server is security with the sufficient encryption then most browsers will display an icon in the form of a pad and lock at the far right of the URL bar. If the colour is green then it means that the encryption of the website is certified to a universal standard (Federal Trade Commission, 2012). The encryption of data within a network can be extended to Wi-Fi networks that are publicly available. 55% of all mobile devices are used to connect to public WiFi networks (itrc, 2012). Connecting to such a network presents a number of potential security risks, one of which is the man-in-the-middle attacks (MitM attacks). A MitM attack consists of another computer within the network intercepting packets in travel within the network. This third party is able to view packets of data that are sent to/from a target user’s machine.</p>

				<p>In conclusion, there’s an extensive number of possible attacks that can be launched on online accounts in order to breach them or obtain personalized data without the appropriate authentication. Many of these attacks however can be easily mitigated by ensuring that when you’re in, crowded, public spaces you’re vigilant and precautious when entering data or just using your device(s) casually. This prevents users from performing a shoulder surfing attack and obtaining information about you and your account(s). When opening emails or browsing online sites users should check that their connection to the website or other online service is encrypted with an SSL certification and when in publicly available wireless networks VPNs should be used to ensure MitM attacks are not launched from within the network the use of a VPN means that the connection maintained locally with the router is encased in another layer of encryption therefore a malicious user within the network that intercepts the packets will be unable to use the intercepted data as a result of the encryption. When creating online accounts, the user should not be naïve and make sure that they are not oversharing their sensitive data. Once the account has been created the user should navigate to the settings and configure their privacy settings appropriately.</p>
